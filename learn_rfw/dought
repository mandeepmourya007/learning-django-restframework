 wrappers provide a few bits of functionality such as making sure you receive Request instances in your view, and adding context to Response objects so that content negotiation can be performed.

 Response objects
REST framework also introduces a Response object, which is a type of TemplateResponse that takes
unrendered content and uses content negotiation to determine the correct content type to return
 to the client.
what about csrf?????????
return Response(data)  # Renders to content type as requested by the client.

If you add a --debug switch to the http requests above, you will be able to see the request type in request headers.

Now go and open the API in a web browser, by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/snippets/.
